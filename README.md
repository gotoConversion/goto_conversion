# goto_conversion (Novel Conversion of Betting Odds to Probabilities)

The most common method used to convert betting odds to probabilities is to normalise the inverse odds (Multiplicative conversion). However, this method does not consider the favourite-longshot bias. 

To the best of our knowledge, there are two existing methods that attempt to consider the favourite-longshot bias. (i) Shin conversion [[1](#1), [2](#2), [3](#3)] maximises the expected profit for the bookmakers assuming a small proportion of bettors have inside information. (ii) Power conversion [[4](#4)] raises all inverse odds to the same constant power. However, both of these methods require iterative computation to convert betting odds to probabilities.

Our proposed method (goto_conversion) is significantly more efficient than Shin and Power conversion because it converts betting odds to probabilities directly without iterative computation.

The goto_conversion reduces all inverse odds by the same units of standard error. This attempts to consider the favourite-longshot bias by utilising the proportionately wider standard errors implied for inverses of longshot odds and vice-versa.

Furthermore, our tables of experiment results below show that the goto_conversion converts betting odds to probabilities more accurately than all three of these existing methods.

# Installation

```

## American Odds

```python
import goto_conversion
goto_conversion.goto_conversion([-500, 240, 460], isAmericanOdds = True)
```
