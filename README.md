# Ease of Use

To use `goto_conversion`, it does not require historical data for model fit, advanced domain knowledge, nor paid computational resources.
Linked below provides five examples of how to use `goto_conversion` in the freely available, Google Colab.

# Abstract

The most common method used to convert betting odds to probabilities is to normalise the inverse odds (Multiplicative conversion). However, this method does not consider the favourite-longshot bias. 

To the best of our knowledge, there are two existing methods that attempt to consider the favourite-longshot bias. (i) Shin conversion [[1](#1),[2](#2),[3](#3)] maximises the expected profit for the bookmakers assuming a small proportion of bettors have inside information. (ii) Power conversion [[4](#4)] raises all inverse odds to the same constant power.

Our proposed method `goto_conversion` reduces all inverse odds by the same units of standard error. This attempts to consider the favourite-longshot bias by utilising the proportionately wider standard errors implied for inverses of longshot odds and vice-versa. Our experiments show `goto_conversion` converts betting odds to probabilities more robustly than all three of these existing methods.

This package is an implementation of `goto_conversion` as well as `efficient_shin_conversion`. The Shin conversion is originally a numerical solution but according to Kizildemir 2024 [[5](#5)], we can enhance its efficiency by reduction to an analytical solution. We have implemented the enhanced Shin conversion proposed by Kizildemir 2024 as `efficient_shin_conversion` in this package.

The favourite-longshot bias is not limited to betting markets, it exists in stock markets too. Thus, we applied the original `goto_conversion` to stock markets by defining the `zero_sum` variant. Under the same philosophy as the original `goto_conversion`, `zero_sum` adjusts all predicted stock prices (e.g. weighted average price) by the same units of standard error to ensure all predicted stock prices relative to the index price (e.g. weighted average nasdaq price) sum to zero. This attempts to consider the favourite-longshot bias by utilising the wider standard errors implied for predicted stock prices with low trade volume and vice-versa.
