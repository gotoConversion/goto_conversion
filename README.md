# Gambling Odds To Outcome probabilities Conversion (goto_conversion)

The most common method used to convert betting odds to probabilities is to normalise the inverse odds (Multiplicative conversion). However, this method does not consider the favourite-longshot bias. 

To the best of our knowledge, there are two existing methods that attempt to consider the favourite-longshot bias. (i) Shin conversion [[1](#1),[2](#2),[3](#3)] maximises the expected profit for the bookmakers assuming a small proportion of bettors have inside information. (ii) Power conversion [[4](#4)] raises all inverse odds to the same constant power. However, both of these methods require iterative computation to convert betting odds to probabilities.

Our proposed method, **G**ambling **O**dds **T**o **O**utcome probabilities **Conversion** (`goto_conversion`) is significantly more efficient than Shin and Power conversion because it converts betting odds to probabilities directly without iterative computation.

The `goto_conversion` reduces all inverse odds by the same units of standard error. This attempts to consider the favourite-longshot bias by utilising the proportionately wider standard errors implied for inverses of longshot odds and vice-versa.

Furthermore, our tables of experiment results show that the `goto_conversion` converts betting odds to probabilities more accurately than all three of these existing methods.

The favourite-longshot bias is not limited to gambling markets, it exists in stock markets too. Thus, we applied the original `goto_conversion` to stock markets by defining the `zero_sum` variant. Under the same philosophy as the original `goto_conversion`, `zero_sum` adjusts all predicted stock prices (e.g. weighted average price) by the same units of standard error to ensure all predicted stock prices relative to the index price (e.g. weighted average nasdaq price) sum to zero. This attempts to consider the favourite-longshot bias by utilising the wider standard errors implied for predicted stock prices with low trade volume and vice-versa.

# Experiment Results

Brier Score was mainly used to evaluate the accuracy of the probabilities implied by each conversion method. The Brier Score is essentially the mean squared error of the probabilities relative to the ground truth. Ranked Probability Score (RPS) was additionally used to evaluate the probabilities for football betting odds because the outcome is ordinal (home win, draw and away win). RPS is essentially the Brier Score on the cumulative probabilities.

The experiment results table directly below is based on the same 6,000 football matches' betting odds (home win, draw or away win) across four different bookmakers. `goto_conversion` outperforms all other conversion methods for all four bookmakers. Kaggle notebook to reproduce the table directly below can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaito510/novel-conversion-of-football-betting-odds).

The experiment results table directly below is based on 6,348 horse races' betting odds for the win and place markets. `goto_conversion` outperforms all other conversion methods for both win and place betting markets.

# Q&A

Q1. I want to know whether the teams in the csv file named mensProbabilitiesTable in the 538 data you created are in 2024 or 2023?

A1. 2024 but it is NOT 538 data, it is my data displayed in a format inspired by 538.
